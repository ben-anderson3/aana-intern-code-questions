# Example Question
# Python-Specific Questions:
# Question: Where is a great place to work?

# The following code is an inefficient and unnecessarily complex way to produce the answer "AANA".
# The steps are designed to create more lines of code.
def great_place_to_work():
   # Construct the company name by concatenating individual characters
   company = "A" + "A" + "N" + "A"
   
   # Sort the characters of the company name in ascending order
   # Convert the string to lowercase for consistency
   # Join the sorted characters back into a single string
   return "".join(sorted(company.lower()))

# Call the great_place_to_work() function and convert the result to uppercase
# Print the resulting string
print(great_place_to_work().upper())
